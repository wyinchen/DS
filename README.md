## My LeetCode Learning Process

1. **March to Early May:**
   - I started by watching videos on C++ programming and data structures by Kong Lingjie and the first few lectures of UCB CS61B, which helped me gain a preliminary understanding of data structures.
   - After practicing some problems on Judge Girl, I realized my understanding was still too superficial. Therefore, I watched two more sets of videos and took detailed notes.
2. **Starting in May:**
   - I began practicing LeetCode problems. Initially, I was unclear about the difficulty and scope of the problems, so I started with the first few problems in the general problem set, focusing on strings, math, and arrays.
   - I then started attempting a little bit more challenging problems, such as tree, binary search, linked list, etc.
   - After few days of trying harder problems, I found that my foundational programming skills were not strong enough, causing me to spend a lot of time solving problems (up to 4-5 hours or more per problem). Given the time pressure, I went back to practicing string problems and some data structure problems that were more suited to my current skill level.
