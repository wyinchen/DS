## My LeetCode Learning Process

1. **March to Early May:**
   - I started by watching videos on C++ programming and data structures by Kong Lingjie and the first few lectures of UCB CS61A, gaining a preliminary understanding of data structures.
   - After practicing some problems on Judge Girl, I realized my understanding was still too superficial. I then watched two more sets of videos, taking detailed notes.

2. **Starting in May:**
   - I began practicing LeetCode problems. Initially, I was unclear about the difficulty and scope of the problems, so I started with the first few problems in the general problem set, focusing on strings, math, and arrays.

3. **Deeper Problem Practice:**
   - I then started attempting more challenging problems, such as [insert specific problem examples here].

4. **Reassessment and Back to Basics:**
   - After about two weeks of trying harder problems, I found that my foundational programming skills were not strong enough, which was causing me to spend a lot of time solving problems. Given the time pressure, I went back to practicing string problems and some simpler data structure problems.
